# Button

The Button component allows a user to place a button on the page

> It's also possible to turn a regular button element
> or link into a basic button by adding the `button` utility to it although that
> method is cosmetic only and lacks the more advanced features of this component.

## Usage

### Use as a link

A Button component can be used to style a link, however you must wrap the component
in the correct routing method of your framework for it to work.

e.g.

```js
<Link href="/marketplace">
  <Button alignIcon="left">
    <ArrowBack /> Return to Home page
  </Button>
</Link>
```

### Adding icons

Anything can be used as a child of the button component and can be styled with
the use of the `className` property. However the component has support for
adding icons.

Your icon should be either an `svg`, `img` or `picture` tag. Alternatively, you
can just add an `.icon` class to any child element and it will be treated as an
icon. You must then apply the `alignIcon` prop to the component which will align
the icon correctly to either the `left` or `right`.

For best results, we recommend using the
[Material Icons from `material-ui`](https://material-ui.com/components/material-icons/)
